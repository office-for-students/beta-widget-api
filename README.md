### Setup

### Pre-Setup

1) Install [.Net Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), if you haven't already.
2) Install python 3.6.8 - the latest stable version that works with Azure client.
```
Mac user:
Install homebrew:
1) /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
2) brew install sashkab/python/python36
3) pip3.6 install -U pip setuptools

Windows user:
```
3) Make sure Python 3.6.8 is set on your PATH, you can check this by running `python3 -v` in terminal window.
4) Install Azure Client
```
Mac user:
brew tap azure/functions
brew install azure-functions-core-tools

Windows user:
```
5) Setup Visual Studio Code, install [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
6) Also install the following extensions for visual studio code - documentation [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery)

```
Python
Azure CLI Tools
Azure Account
Azure Functions
Azure Storage
```

7) Sign into Azure with Visual Studio Code - follow documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/tutorial-vs-code-serverless-python#_sign-in-to-azure)

#### Building resources and running azure function locally

1) Requires [beta-data-pipelines](https://github.com/office-for-students/beta-data-pipelines) to have been built and run once to load data into cosmos db

2) Retrieve all cosmos db environment variables (see configuration settings) from azure cosmos db instance that your widget API will be connecting to.

3) Retrieve the Azure Storage conection string from azure storage container instance.

3) Create your local.settings.json file at root level of repository and include all environment variables in the configuration settings table above.

6) Create a virtual machine to run the azure function application by running `python -m venv .env` at root level of repository.

7) Run service on virtual machine by doing the following:
```
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
func host start
```
